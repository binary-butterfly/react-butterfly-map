    Some libraries think it's a great idea to apply a padding to __every__ button.
    Since maplibre uses a background image for the attribution control and does not expose the attribution button
    component itself, this would look really bad (button way too large, multiple icons next to one another).
    So now we've got this __great__ solution.
